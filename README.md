# Project Description 
The **Microsoft Ajax Minifier** enables you to improve the performance of your web applications by reducing the size of your Cascading Style Sheet and JavaScript files. 

Minify both JS and CSS files, and now optionally produce Source Maps for JavaScript files. 

Use the -analyze option on the command-line to provide lint-style syntax checking and variable analysis of your code. 

Use the -pretty option on the command-line to output in a nice, easy-to-read multi-line format (good for un-minifying minified code). 

JavaScript and CSS files minified with Ajax Minifier should work as-is; you shouldn’t have to do anything special in your code to get good results. If your file doesn’t work after minification, first check to see if your JavaScript code contains eval statements that might require you to use a different –evals switch. If your file still doesn’t work, please file a report on the “Issue” page so I can get Ajax Minifier fixed.  

If you have any new feature requests, please feel free to bring them up on the "Issues" page. We cannot guarantee feature requests will make it into the code.

 ## Offical NuGet Package

There is an official **NuGet** package for the DLL version of Microsoft Ajax Minifier, if you prefer to manage your C# projects in that manner:
